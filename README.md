# Introduction

**Every day, we encounter numerous products on digital platforms, presenting us with various choices within the same category. Choosing a product can be daunting, but customer reviews come to our aid. When customers purchase a product, they often leave a rating and review detailing their experience, helping others make informed decisions. However, manually assessing each review for positivity or negativity can be time-consuming. Fortunately, advancements in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and artificial intelligence have greatly simplified this process.**

## What is sentiment analysis?

**Sentiment Analysis is a technique to classify text that determines whether a message expresses a positive, negative, or neutral sentiment. Businesses are interested in understanding customer sentiments because customers frequently share their thoughts and emotions. Analyzing customer feedback automatically through technology enables brands to listen closely to their customers, thereby aligning their products and services with customer needs.**

## Problem Statement

**The objective is to develop a platform that provides concise summaries of critical business information, such as recent reviews, overall ratings, sentiment distribution, and trending keywords. Currently, businesses must manually read and interpret a large volume of customer reviews, comments, and concerns, which requires significant effort, time, and resources.**
