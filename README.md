# Sentiment Analysis of Film Reviews

## Project Overview
This is a machine learning project that performs sentiment analysis on movie reviews. It uses natural language processing (NLP) techniques and a Random Forest classifier to categorize reviews into five sentiment levels: Very Bad, Bad, Neutral, Good, and Very Good.

## Key Features
- Preprocesses and analyzes movie review text data
- Implements TF-IDF vectorization for feature extraction
- Utilizes a Random Forest classifier for multi-class sentiment prediction
- Provides comprehensive visualizations for data insights:
  - Sentiment distribution
  - Confusion matrix for model performance
  - Word clouds for each sentiment level
  - Feature importance analysis
  - Review length vs. sentiment analysis
  - Average word length vs. sentiment analysis
  - Most common words for each sentiment level

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas for data manipulation
- Scikit-learn for machine learning models
- NLTK for natural language processing
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization
- WordCloud for generating word clouds
